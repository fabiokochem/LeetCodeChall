/*
This code was my first attempt to solve the problem. It is a brute force solution, which is not the best way to solve this problem.
I was trying to think of a better solution but I preferred to submit this one to check if my logic was correct and to show one way to solve this problem.

The steps I built to reach this solution:
    - Iterate over all possible combinations of elements from the array using nested loops.
    - Check if each combination satisfies the given condition defined in the problem.
    - Return the result or output after processing all combinations.

This is a brute force solution with complexity O(nÂ²), which may not work well for large inputs.
