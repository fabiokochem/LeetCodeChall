/*
This code was my first attempt to solve the problem. It is a brute force solution, which is not the best way to solve this problem.
I was trying to think of a better solution but I preferred to submit this one to check if my logic was correct and to show one way to solve this problem.

The steps I built to reach this solution:
    - Iterate over all possible combinations of elements from the array using nested loops.
    - Check if each combination satisfies the given condition defined in the problem.
    - Return the result or output after processing all combinations.

This is a brute force solution with complexity O(nÂ²), which may not work well for large inputs.

This solution is the best way to solve this problem. In this solution, we use mathematical insights or efficient data structures.
The steps I built to reach this solution:
    - Analyze the problem to identify patterns or properties that can reduce computation.
    - Use a mathematical formula or an efficient algorithm to calculate the desired result in O(n) or better time complexity.
    - Return the result directly without unnecessary iterations.
